Foodie is a rails web based app that allows travelers to create itineraries for restaurants that the user will want to visit on their trip.

A user is allowed to sign up with Facebook or they can create their own login. Once their information has been submitted and validated, the user will access the Foodie Welcome page. They will then be allowed to 'signout', return to this welcome page by clicking 'home', or clicking their name to enter their itinerary home page.

Once the user has entered their specific home page they create an itinerary, see their existing itineraries, the restaurants that they have visited, and a button to see all the itineraries sorted based on the most recently created and saved itinerary in their database.

On creation, an Itinerary will have a name, for example, "Trip to South Carolina", it will have a city location, such as "Georgetown", and it will prompt the user to enter a reservation time that they would prefer for a restaurant. Once the itinerary has been created, the user will be directed to that specific Itinerary's show page and will be allowed to search for restaurants based on the location that they have entered. They will be able to add one restaurant to their itinerary and update the information.
